# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The codebase is currently undergoing a refactor in a new language and a new framework.
Only the code on the `main` branch will be supported with security updates. The old
support cycle will resume with the release of v1.0.0.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Main    | :white_check_mark: |

| v0.1.0 | :x:                 |
| v0.0.1  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability with Captain, contact the project maintainer(s) directly. **Do not
open a ticket.** Upon successful verification and duplication of the vulnerability, a fix
will be released as soon as possible. A public notice will be sent out within 30 days,
after a fix is released if possible.

If you find a vulnerability with Proxmox, Ansible, or another tool used by Captain, please
open an issue with the maintainers of that project, as there is little we can do on the
Captain side to fix it.
