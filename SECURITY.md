# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As all versions being released right now are pre-production, security patches will only
be offered on the latest revision of the current minor release. Once the codebase settles
down after the major refactor in v0.4.0, more versions will be supported on a consistent cycle.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v0.3.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| v0.2.0 | :x:                |
| v0.1.0 | :x:                |
| v0.0.1  | :x: |
|< v0.0.1 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability with Captain, contact the project maintainer directly. **Do not
open a ticket.** Upon successful verification and duplication of the vulnerability, a fix
will be released as soon as possible. A public notice will be sent out within 30 days,
after a fix is released if possible.

If you find a vulnerability with Proxmox, Ansible, or another tool used by Captain, please
open an issue with the maintainers of that project, as there is little we can do on the
Captain side to fix it.
