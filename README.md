Captain is a container orchestration and streamlined PaaS provider for Proxmox-based datacenters.

Project Goals:
- Quickly create LXC containers based on a set of common defaults.
- Seamlessly scale instances up and down.
- Provide health checks and automatic crash mitigation.
- Easy to use through the CLI, web interface, or REST API.

Captain is currently undergoing a refactor to make it more maintainable before moving on to new microservices. This refactor is part of release v1.0.0.

Roadmap:
- Integrated DNS server with service discovery.
- SaaS platform on top of Captain.
- Prepackaged "AWS-style" services that run on Captain.
